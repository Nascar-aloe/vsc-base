## 0.1.1

Fix incorrect name of typings in package.json

## 0.1.0

BREAKING CHANGES!

But this is still not version 1.0.0 so other change can still come.
(Rename one or two methods...)

Now base on monorope: vsc-base
with vsc-base, vsc-base.org and vsc-script on one mono-respo.

Lots of new methods.
Important one:

-  pick (Let the user pick deom a list)
-  appendLineToActiveDocument ect (New methods for editing the open document)
-  relative Find path methods.

(Documentation will be added to vsc-base.org, but this will be later..)
Version update will come when it happens.

## 0.0.7

Move vsc-base, vsc-base.org and vsc-script to one common repository.
For testing of vsc-base and because its primary use is vsc-script,
its easier to keep them as one mono-respo.

## 0.0.6

Add makeDir method.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## vsc-base.org

Its the documentation website for vsc-base

The website can be found here: [vsc-base.org](http://vsc-base.org)

Its part of a mono-respo with vsc-bas and vsc-script.

## Scripts:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Notes on 'Annoations' (The code and desciprtions)

The annotation are auto created with a vsc-script in vsc-script project (with in this mono-respo).
Dont do any changes for them in this project.
To generate them, open the entire mono-respo or the vsc-script project in vscode, then run the vsc-script: compileVsc

This will create all anotation and the AllAnnotation component, in the allAnnotation folder.
(Dont rename or remove this folder!)
